# 🌱 Potato Disease Classifier  

This project is a **Potato Disease Classification** system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. It classifies potato leaves into three categories:  

- ✅ **Healthy**  
- ⚠️ **Early Blight**  
- ❌ **Late Blight**  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **🧠 Deep Learning Model**: Trained on a dataset of potato leaf images.  
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Upload images for prediction (built with HTML/CSS and FastAPI).  
- **💊 Disease Solutions**: Suggests treatments based on the classification.  
- **☁️ Weather Integration**: Provides weather-based farming tips using OpenWeather API.
