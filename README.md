Potato Disease Classifier ðŸŒ±
This project is a Potato Disease Classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It classifies potato leaves into three categories:

Healthy
Early Blight
Late Blight

Features::
Deep Learning Model: Trained on a dataset of potato leaf images.
Web Interface: Upload images for prediction (built with HTML/CSS and FastAPI).
Disease Solutions: Suggests treatments based on the classification.
Weather Integration: Provides weather-based farming tips using OpenWeather API.

Installation::
Clone the repository:
--git clone https://github.com/NewDev18/Potato-Disease-Detection.git
--cd potato-disease-classifier

Install dependencies:
--pip install -r requirements.txt

Run :
--python main.py

Usage::
Upload a potato leaf image.
View the classification result (healthy, early blight, or late blight).
Access solutions and weather-based tips.

Dataset::
The model was trained on a dataset organized into three classes:

Potato___Healthy
Potato___Early_Blight
Potato___Late_Blight
